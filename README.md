## About Potato's Origin
Potato is a single page RPG created by Oliver Darkshire ([@deathbybadger on twitter](https://twitter.com/deathbybadger)). Oliver Darkshire also has a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/deathbybadger) with many other single page RPGs available for people to download and play for themselves for free, however, I recommend subscribing to support Oliver for all of his hard work entertaining us.

## Story Line
In Potato you are a halfling, just trying to exist. Meanwhile, the dark lord rampages across the world. You do not care about this. You are trying to farm potatoes because what could a halfling possibly do about it anyway.
